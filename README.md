# scorekeeper
A very boring scorekeeping website for two teams/players which updates the score of each team/player as the match progresses. The reset button resets the match, setting the score to 0-0 while the drag down allows you to select the number of points played for. Don't let the featured image mislead you, this scorekeeper can be used for plenty of games other than lawn tennis. Languages used: HTML and Javascript. CSS Framework used: Bulma
